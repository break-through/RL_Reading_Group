README

I've written most files in such a way that you would not need to modify
them. So, DON'T CHEAT! DO NOT MODIFY FILES.

What you can do, however, is to implement interfaces (NOTE: abstract classes
*are* interfaces too!). Ideally, that's what you should do!

Then, to test your implementations, go over to FigFiveRunner.java (the only
runner that is currently written).

If this Java setup works well, then we might actually implement more runners
for different kinds of models!
